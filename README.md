March Madness Predictor
Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict NCAA tournament outcomes based on team performance metrics. The model applies a Random Forest classifier to analyze win probabilities and simulate the tournament.

Dataset & Features
Each team is represented by:
-Win percentage
-Points scored per game
-Points allowed per game
-Rebounds per game
-Assists per game
-Turnover rate
-Conference ranking
-Tournament performance (binary: 1 = advanced, 0 = eliminated)

Technology used
-Python
-Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
-Scikit-learn for machine learning



How It Works
✔ Prepares features from historical team stats ✔ Trains a Random Forest model to classify tournament success ✔ Predicts each team's probability of advancing in the tournament ✔ Simulates the entire tournament and predicts the likely winner
